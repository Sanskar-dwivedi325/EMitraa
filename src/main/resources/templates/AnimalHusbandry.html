    <h2>Introduction to Animal Husbandry</h2>

    <h4>
        <li> Animal husbandry refers to the science and art of raising, breeding, and managing domestic animals for various purposes. These purposes include food production, labor, companionship, and other resources.
            It          involves the care, health management, and selective breeding of animals to optimize their productivity and well-being.

        <li>
            <b>Feeding and Nutrition</b>
            -Formulating balanced diets using grains, forages, and supplements to meet nutritional requirements.</br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Healthcare and Disease Management</b>
            -Administering vaccinations, deworming, and veterinary care to prevent and treat diseases.</br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reproduction and Reproductive Management</b>
            Managing breeding cycles and implementing reproductive technologies for improved breeding outcomes.</br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Waste Management</b> Implementing strategies for proper handling and disposal of animal waste to minimize environmental impact.</br>
        </li>
        <li>. <b>Poultry Husbandry:</b>
            Breeding: Selective breeding for traits such as egg production, meat quality, and disease resistance.</br>
            Housing and Facilities: Providing suitable housing structures like coops or cages with proper ventilation and lighting.</br>
            Feeding and Nutrition: Formulating diets rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals for optimal growth and egg production.</br>
            Healthcare and Disease Management: Implementing biosecurity measures and vaccination programs to prevent diseases like avian flu.</br>
        <li><b>Reproduction and Reproductive Management</b></li> Managing brooding and incubation for hatching eggs and raising chicks.</br>
        <li><b>Waste Management</b></li> Managing poultry litter to control odor and minimize environmental pollution.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Husbandry:</b>
            Breeding: Selecting dairy cattle with high milk production potential and good conformation.
            Housing and Facilities: Providing comfortable and clean barns or free-stall housing for dairy cows.
            Feeding and Nutrition: Formulating diets rich in energy and protein to support milk production.
            Healthcare and Disease Management: Regular health checks, vaccination programs, and proper hoof care to maintain cow health.
            Reproduction and Reproductive Management: Implementing breeding programs and artificial insemination to optimize breeding efficiency.
            Waste Management: Proper handling and disposal of dairy waste to prevent contamination of water sources.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Aquaculture Husbandry:</b>
            Breeding: Selective breeding for traits like growth rate, disease resistance, and tolerance to environmental conditions.
            Housing and Facilities: Constructing ponds, tanks, or cages suitable for different aquatic species.
            Feeding and Nutrition: Providing balanced diets formulated for specific species and life stages.
            Healthcare and Disease Management: Monitoring water quality, implementing biosecurity measures, and treating diseases as needed.
            Reproduction and Reproductive Management: Controlling breeding conditions and optimizing spawning for reproduction.
            Waste Management: Managing effluents and nutrient recycling to minimize environmental impact.
        </li>
        Each type of animal husbandry requires specific management practices tailored to the needs of the species involved, ensuring optimal health, welfare, and productivity while minimizing environmental impact.
